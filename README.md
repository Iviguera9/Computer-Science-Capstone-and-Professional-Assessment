# Computer-Science-Capstone-and-Professional-Assessment

# Self Introduction
My name is Ian Viguera Rivera. Since I was very passionate for emerging technologies, mechanical engineering, and programming from early age. The chase for turning a passion to a degree has been a difficult and tedious one, as there has been many challenges along the way. The benefit from these challenges is that it has improved some of the most important skills used in computer science careers, ranging from critical thinking to adaptability. These skills are demonstrated on the enhancement project breakdown, down below, or in my inventory on previous and/or personal projects.

# Professional Self-Assessment
I started chasing my Computer Science degree since 2016. What my young mind though was going to be a smooth-sailed path into a prestigious degree, and then a high-paying career, quickly turned into a challenge. My first lesson in this journey was that challenges are not a disadvantage whatsoever, as they provide guidence and experince that can be used in the present or future. As an example, I remember how one of the most basic programs gave me one of the biggest challenges at the time. At the time, I had trouble with some of the basic computer science topics and how to implement them, making the project not up to my expectations. This challenge served me as a learning experience, and I kept reviewing topics and practicing on the project for my own benefit. This act of perseverance only benefitted my journey, as I implemented the skills learned to other projects and examples simmilar to the previous one. Furthermore the SNHU environment has been of magnificent help and guidance, with an efficient teaching system, and excellent administrative and teaching staff. The appreciation and guidance of such excellent evironment encompassess a major role on my professional upbringing. Overall, my skills on collaborative, technical, and knowledgeable evironments have since grown exponentially. I am now able to construct a backend/frontend digital system with a dedicated database and simplistic UI. It helps that my creativity, ambission, and experience have spawned original ideas that could be of great help for my professional future. Although I have learned the necessary concepts, and became proficient on them, my aim is to keep learning and practicing alongside my professional career to facilitate, adapt, and enhance my future projects.
